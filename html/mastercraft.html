 	Canadian Tire’s own Mastercraft Maximum brand is coming out with its own brushless drill, becoming the first private brand to do so. It’s about bringing in this motor life extending technology to the masses at a more affordable price. Additionally, this drill is also triggerless which means better ergonomics and higher efficiency for the user.
