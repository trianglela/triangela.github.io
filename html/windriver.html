<b>Athletic Fit Stretch HD1 Water-Repellant Jeans</b>
<br>
<br>Jeans you can depend on, these men’s WindRiver rinse wash jeans are built for a rugged but design-conscious lifestyle. They can take you from backyard BBQ to backcountry camping. Featuring HYPER-DRI® HD1 and COOLMAX technologies, these breathable pants repel water and wick moisture away from the skin. The athletic fit gives you extra room in the seat and thigh for easy mobility, while the stretch fabric adds flexibility. Pair these jeans with a classic shirt for a dressier look, or a tee for casual activities.
